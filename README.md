# E-commerce-Back-End


## Description
As a fullstack web developer, I want to create an application that will help internet retail companies with back end for e-commerce websites that use the latest technologies so that those  companies can compete with other e-commerce companies.


# Usage

To use this application, first open the application and add your database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file.  You will then be able to connect to a  database using Sequelize.  When you enter schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data.  Once you enter the command to invoke the application, your server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.  When you open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.  When you test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, you will be able to successfully create, update, and delete data in your database.
